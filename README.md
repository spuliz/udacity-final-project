# Udacity Machine Learning Capstone Project
This GitHub repository hosts the Capstone project I developed and completed as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

## Domain Background
Arvato Financial Services is a company operating in the mail-order sales business in Germany and is a subsidiary of Bertelsmann.
The company wants to grow their customer base by better targeting clusters of the general population with their marketing campaigns.

## Datasets
Demographics data of the general population and of prior customers of the business will be used in order to identify those individuals who are more likely to respond to the marketing campaign and to become customers of the mail-order company.
Datasets are available to use within the related Udacity Workspace and cannot be publicly shared in this repository.

## The ML system
The overall system can be diveded in two parts:
- The first part where unsupervised learning methods will be used to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create clusters and compare them.
- The second part where the previous analysis will be used against a target dataset with attributes from customers targeted of a mail order campaign. A supervised learning approach will be used in order to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not an individual will respond to the marketing campaign.

## Libraries used
The Jupyter Notebook is written in Python.

The main packages used are:

- numpy: scientific computing tools

- pandas: data structures and data analysis tools

- matplotlib: data visualisation tools

- seaborn: data visualisation tools

- scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine Learning library in Python


## Setup
install the packages listed in the file requirements.txt
